
(Hacker Rank Challenge) : Binary Search Tree
Challenge : Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

            Root: If node is root node.
            Leaf: If node is leaf node.
            Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.




Solution :

SELECT DISTINCT  Tree1.N,CASE WHEN Tree1.P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
                              WHEN Tree2.P IS NOT NULL THEN 'Inner'
                              WHEN Tree2.P IS NULL THEN 'Leaf'
                              END AS Nodes
        FROM BST Tree1 
        LEFT JOIN BST Tree2 ON Tree1.N = Tree2.P
